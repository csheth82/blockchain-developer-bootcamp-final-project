## An app to get a flash loan on Aave or DyDx protocol.

Flash loans are a fascinating creation of DeFi. I want to allow the user to select which platform and token they want to use for a flash loan and encapsulate their own custom transactions within that flash loan. Aave protocol supports full functionality on the testnet. As these are atomic transactions, either the entire chain of transactions succeed or they all fail. 

The user can select:
1) What platform to get a flash loan on
2) What token to borrow
3) Write their own custom transactions (arbitrage, liquidation etc) to stick in between the borrowing and repaying of the flash loan.
